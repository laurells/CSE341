// This code defines a simple route in a Node.js application using the Express framework.

//Import the 'Router' module from the 'express' library using the 'require' statement and assign it to a constant variable.
const routes = require('express').Router();
//Define a 'GET' route for the root ('/') path using the 'routes.get()' method. 
//Whenever a client makes a 'GET' request to the root path, the callback function with '(req, res)' parameters will be triggered.
routes.get('/', (req, res) => {
//In the callback function, the 'res.send()' method is called with the string ' ' as the response body. 
//The string is sent as the response to the client when the route is accessed.
  res.send('Laurels Echichinwo Jr.');
});

//The 'routes' object, which represents the defined route, is exported using 'module.exports' so that it can be used in other parts of the application where this module is required.
module.exports = routes;
